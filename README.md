+ **Project summary**
	+ New York City reported the first COVID-19 cases on March 1,2020 and our lives have changed drastically onwards. New York State has the highest numbers of confirmed cases in the United States till mid-July and most cases were in New York City where half of the population lives. NYC took control of the virus with the leadership of governor Cuomo implementing a complete shutdown, masks mandates, stopping all business and restricting social gatherings. Although cases have been reduced in NYC, the pandemic is far from over as the virus mutates and cold weather and holiday season leads to resurgence.

	+ In effort to stop the pandemic, The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services expedited the vaccine development program with Operation Warp Speed. In early November, both Moderna and Pfizer released promising results on vaccine trials and by mid December 2020, both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were approved by the FDA. Knowing that COVID-19 vaccine is a vital tool to stop the pandemic, we designed this website to help New Yorkers get vaccine information and track virus updates in different areas.
